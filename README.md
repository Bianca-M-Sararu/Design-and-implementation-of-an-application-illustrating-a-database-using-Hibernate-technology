# Design-and-implementation-of-an-application-illustrating-a-database-using-Hibernate-technology
The description is attached in the README file.

The purpose of this project is to highlight how to model and implement an M:N relationship between entities in a database using a specific technology, such as the one chosen - Hibernate.
The relationship between musicians and albums is managed through an intermediate table, called songs , which transforms the M:N association into two associations - (1:N) musicians - songs and (1:N) albums - songs . The project will include a web application developed using Java Server Pages (JSP) technology and the Hibernate framework that will allow performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all database tables. The application will be built in NetBeans and the database will be developed in the MySql DBMS.
